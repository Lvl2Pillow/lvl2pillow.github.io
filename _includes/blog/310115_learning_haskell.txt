## Learning Haskell
So, I've been having a little read and research now and then for a while, and Haskell seems quite interesting.
Today, and hopefully for the next few days, I'm going to go through the tutorial here: <http://learnyouahaskell.com/chapters> and hopefully
finally get a taste of functional programming and learn the basics of Haskell. I'll keep posts about my progress and interesting things I learn,
and my thoughts about it.
